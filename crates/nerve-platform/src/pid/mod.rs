//! Is that process still there?
//!
//! A closed terminal never sends SessionEnd, so without this a job would sit in
//! every surface forever. The question is the same on both platforms and the
//! bias is the same too: **only a definite "no such process" counts as dead.**
//! A pid we may not query is still running, and an answer we do not understand
//! is not evidence of death — closing a live agent's row would be far worse
//! than leaving a dead one on screen until its next report.
//!
//! Callers inject this behind their own trait (`nerve-hub`'s `PidProbe`) so the
//! state machines stay testable without an OS.
