//! Bringing a hub up, at most once per window.
//!
//! Every arm of [`Launch`] is fail-open: none is an error the caller may turn
//! into a non-zero exit. A missing hub, a refused spawn and a throttled retry
//! all mean the same thing to tmux — the segment shows the offline placeholder
//! and the user's tmux is untouched.
//!
//! The throttle exists because a hub that will not come up must not be fired at
//! the OS on every reconnect. A hub that *is* up is never spawned at all:
//! health is consulted first, so the one this surface started a second ago is
//! recognised rather than duplicated.
