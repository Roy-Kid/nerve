//! The loopback hub endpoint.
//!
//! A transport and nothing more — it knows about requests, responses and
//! event-stream framing, and nothing about frames, health or jobs. The modules
//! that speak to the hub ([`crate::launch`] health, [`crate::stream`] SSE, and
//! the popup's one-shot job read) adapt it to their own port, so no module has
//! to own a connection to be unit-testable.
//!
//! HTTP and event-stream framing are a dependency, not something kept here.
//! Both have edge cases that a hand-rolled reader gets wrong quietly: chunked
//! transfer encoding may split a `data:` line across two chunks, headers fold,
//! and a `data:` field may legitimately span several lines. `reqwest` and
//! `eventsource-stream` handle those; this file wires them to the one port.
//!
//! Every method here is blocking to its caller. The runtime is current-thread,
//! private to one [`Hub`], and never reaches a UI loop — a surface's ratatui or
//! egui loop stays exactly as synchronous as it was.
//!
//! The port is fixed at 17890. It is the hub's single-instance lock and is
//! hard-coded by the agent hooks (CLAUDE.md invariant 2), so it is deliberately
//! not configurable here either.
