//! Jobs, bucketed by the machine that reported them.
//!
//! Buckets appear in first-seen order and are then titled case-insensitively,
//! so the list is stable across frames rather than reshuffling as the hub's
//! order changes. Within a bucket the order is [`crate::sort::compare_jobs`].
//!
//! Sections hold *indices* into the slice they were built from, not clones —
//! a surface already owns the snapshot and re-cloning every job per frame is
//! the kind of work a 150 ms frame pump cannot afford.
