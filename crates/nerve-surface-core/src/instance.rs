//! What the lock protects is the hub's refcount. A second surface that also
//! opened a stream would hold the hub alive after the first one left
//! (CLAUDE.md invariant 4), so a process that does not own the lock must never
//! open one.
//!
//! Where the lock *lives* is the surface's business, not this module's: the
//! tmux sidebar keeps it in a tmux user option, which dies with the server it
//! belongs to and leaves nothing on disk (acceptance A11); another surface may
//! reasonably use a registry key or a bound port. [`LockStore`] is that seam,
//! and the ownership rule below is the same either way.
