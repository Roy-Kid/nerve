//! One SSE attach, and how long to wait before the next one.
//!
//! The connection *is* a surface's refcount presence: the hub counts open
//! streams, so holding one open is what keeps it alive and dropping one is how
//! it learns this surface left (CLAUDE.md invariant 4). Nothing else here has
//! to know that.
//!
//! Blocking and pull-based, with no runtime and no clock: [`Backoff`] only
//! computes a delay and the composition root is what waits. That is what lets a
//! whole reconnect story be a unit test, and what lets a terminal, an editor
//! and a tray share one implementation of it.
