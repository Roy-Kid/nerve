//! The hover text behind the tray icon.
//!
//! `Shell_NotifyIcon` caps `szTip` at **128 UTF-16 code units including the
//! terminating NUL**, so the budget is 127 — counted in code units, not
//! characters and not bytes. A job named `项目` costs 2 units per character and
//! an emoji costs 2 for one character, so anything that counts `chars()` or
//! `len()` will silently hand Windows a string it truncates itself, mid-glyph.
//!
//! Two lines: what the machine is doing, and the one job most worth returning
//! to. The second line is dropped before the first is ever shortened.
