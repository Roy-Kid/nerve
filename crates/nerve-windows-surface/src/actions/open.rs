//! Deciding where "Open" goes, before anything is opened.
//!
//! A pure function, so the whole decision table is a test rather than a thing
//! discovered by clicking. The two rules worth stating out loud:
//!
//! - **A path belonging to another machine is never handed to the local
//!   shell.** `C:\work\nerve` on a colleague's laptop is very likely also a
//!   directory here, and opening the wrong one silently is worse than opening
//!   nothing. An IDE deep link is the exception because it routes itself.
//! - **The URL a producer emitted is never rewritten.** `vscode://file/C:/…`
//!   is the hook's contract; a surface that "fixes" it is guessing.
