//! Painting one attach into the tmux status line.
//!
//! The attach itself — opening it, reading frames, backing off — is
//! [`nerve_surface_core::stream`]. What is left here is what only a tmux
//! surface does with it: render a [`SummaryRenderer`] template into a
//! `SegmentWriter`, and notice when the tmux server has gone away.
//!
//! [`StreamSession`] never sleeps; the composition root waits. That is what
//! lets a whole reconnect story be a unit test.
//!
//! ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//! When the offline placeholder is written: every attach that ends writes it —
//! a failed `open`, a clean close and a connection that died mid-flight alike.
//! In all three there is no hub behind the numbers any more, and a status line
//! that keeps painting stale counts lies. [`Attempt::ServerGone`] writes
//! nothing: there is no tmux left to write to.
