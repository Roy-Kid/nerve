//! Turning writes into frames, once per window instead of once per write.
//!
//! An agent hook can push a dozen snapshots in a few milliseconds (a tool
//! finishing, a permission prompt, a status line). Rendering a frame for each
//! would spend more time serialising than the surface spends drawing, so a
//! change only *schedules* a frame: the pump waits out a short window, then
//! publishes one frame for everything that landed in it. Frames are full sets,
//! so coalescing loses nothing.
//!
//! Two seams, deliberately separate: [`ChangeSignal`] is the write edge (the
//! HTTP handlers raise it and know nothing else about frames), [`Broadcaster`]
//! is the read edge (it renders and fans out).
