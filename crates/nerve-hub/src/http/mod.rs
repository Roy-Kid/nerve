//! The loopback HTTP surface: what producers POST and what surfaces GET.
//!
//! Ported from `Nerve/Nerve/Ingest/IngestServer.swift`. Handlers decode a body,
//! call the store, and answer `(StatusCode, Json)` — they never panic, never
//! answer 5xx, and never derive display state.
//!
//! Everything about *whether* a request is allowed in (peer, size) and what
//! every answer carries (CORS) lives in [`guard`], so no handler repeats a
//! cross-cutting rule.
